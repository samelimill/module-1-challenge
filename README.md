# Bootcamp Module 1 Challenge
This challenge consists of refactoring HTML and CSS files.
In both appearance and function, the site remains unchanged.

Changes made include:

- Replacing all div elements with semantic HTML elements, to aide SEO and accessibility.
- Adding alt text to each image
- Consolidated repetitive sections of code in CSS using new selectors and semantic HTML selectors.
- Added comments in both CSS and HTML files.
